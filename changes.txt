We added two classes to represent expressions and statements added from Frex:

src/soot/jimple/JregExpr.java
src/soot/jimple/JregStmt.java

We changed the implementation of a few classes to incorporate the new types
in standard visitors and in the code that generates jasmin output:

src/soot/jimple/JasminClass.java
src/soot/jimple/AbstractStmtSwitch.java
src/soot/jimple/StmtSwitch.java
src/soot/AbstractJasminClass.java
src/soot/toolkits/exceptions/AbstractThrowAnalysis.java
src/soot/toolkits/exceptions/UnitThrowAnalysis.java

And we removed some print statements from the following files:

src/soot/jimple/toolkits/callgraph/OnFlyCallGraphBuilder.java
src/soot/jimple/spark/SparkTransformer.java
